# ML Project: Supervised Learning - Drunk Smurfs

## TODO

1. Actually finalize the project :)
2. **Remember** to also include the `html` versions of the notebooks
3. Check, double check and triple check for mistakes
4. Reformat the code
5. Adjust markdown sections of notebooks to be more clear

## Content of this repository

In this repository you will find all of the `.ipynb` notebooks and datasets for a project I had for the course Machine Learning.

## Folder structure

### Files

1. `Prepare.ipynb` contains the code for Pre-processing the dataset
2. `Merging.ipynb` contains the code for merging all 3 exported datasets together
3. `Answer.ipynb` contains the code where the final list of guests is returned

### Datasets

`/data/` contains all datasets

- `/data/cleaned` contains the cleaned (pre-processed) `train_V2.csv`
- `/data/exported` contains the exported datasets from all 3 models + 1 where all 3 are merged

### Models

`/models/` contains the notebooks for the models

1. `/models/Project_Revenue/` directory contains my model for the first assignment
2. `/models/Project_Damage_Incident/` directory contains my model for the second assignment
3. `/models/Project_Damage_Amount/` directory contains my model for the third assignment

## Assignment context

Among all international hotel guests, Smurfs are burdened with the upkeep of a singular reputation: they are (supposedly) the rowdiest bunch one can entertain, and are equally well-known for unbridled spending as for racking up extensive costs in damages to hotel infrastructure, staff, and occasionally also other guests â€“ costs which typically cannot be recovered once the guest has sought out the safety of his (or her) homeland.
It is your job as a data scientist to screen applying Smurfs clients for an exclusive hotel in the Bahamas - yes, it's the kind of hotel you need to apply for!
