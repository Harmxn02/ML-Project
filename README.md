# ML Project: Supervised Learning - Drunk Smurfs

## Content of this repository

In this repository you will find all of the `.ipynb` notebooks and datasets for a project I had for the course Machine Learning.

## Assignment context

Among all international hotel guests, Smurfs are burdened with the upkeep of a singular reputation: they are (supposedly) the rowdiest bunch one can entertain, and are equally well-known for unbridled spending as for racking up extensive costs in damages to hotel infrastructure, staff, and occasionally also other guests â€“ costs which typically cannot be recovered once the guest has sought out the safety of his (or her) homeland.
It is your job as a data scientist to screen applying Smurfs clients for an exclusive hotel in the Bahamas - yes, it's the kind of hotel you need to apply for!
